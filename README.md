# Crazy 8s!

created on: nov-07-2024

My version of a classic card game which happens to be my favourite.

## Rules
The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards before your opponent! Each player is dealt 5 cards. The remaining cards stay in the draw deck and the top card is turned over.

The card you play has to match either the suit or number of the top card.

If you don't have any cards you can play you must pick up one from the draw deck and pass your turn. If there are no more cards in the draw deck you must pass your turn.

### Special cards!
- All 2s mean that your opponent has to pick up two cards!  Your opponent can still play cards on their turn
- Q of spades means your opponent has to pick up five cards! Again, your opponent can still play cards on their turn
- All 8s are crazy! That means you can change the suit of the top card to anything you like when played. This ends your turn, however, and your opponent can still foil your plans

### Moves to come
- Layering! Layering allows you to play multiple cards at once. But that's a mechanic for later ;)
- Countdown! First you'll deal 8 cards and try to lose all those. Once you achieve that, you pick up seven more and do it all again! Then 6, then 5, then 4, and so on until you get to zero! Then you win!
